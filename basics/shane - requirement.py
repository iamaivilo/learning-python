# Shane is typing in this doc, it's about the banking system that we are building. We plan to sell it to the bank after we complete the program.

# Day 1 Tasks
# define a bank class
# with multiple functions
# create function takes in an integer as an account id
# deposit function takes in an integer as the account id and an integer as the amount of money you want to save to the bank, it will save the money to the bank account
# withdraw function takes in an integer as the account id and an integer as the ammount of money you want to take out, it will withdraw the money from your bank account, 
#   if you don't have enough money money in your account, it will print Not Enough Fund"

# Day 2, Discuss about what's needed to improve the bank. And we find out 3 things:
# 1. the data can not be stored inthe systems, so when the systems or the program restarts, all the data will be gone
# 2. edge cases, for example: when user enters the same id with another user, the sysetm can not detect it. 
# and if the user enters negative numbers, the system can not detect it.
# and if the user enters string instead of numbers, the system not detect it. 
# 3. not secure because there's no password, everybody can use the account id to withdraw money
# So, today, we are going to fix #2
